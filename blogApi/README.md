You are going to build a mini social network which fetches posts along with
a detail page with its own comments.
The API that is going to be used is called JSONPlaceholder(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

I tried my best to get all the features like comment fetch section, addFavourite, pagination, allpost.

I made the UI like we have favourite only on individual post page noreload, only one index.html file

### Working of website is like this
